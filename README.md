# pi-projects
Raspberry Pi files I created for Python, C#, C, and Scratch
These will only work on Raspberry Pi OS (Raspian) or RPiOS-Based OSes on RPi4
You will need also guizero python library for GUI Projects. Some work on micro:bit. You will need mono for the.exe/.cs files. You will need scratch 3.0 for the .sb3 files.
NOTE: Some Projects will not work
You can edit and use the code in any way but dont name the a repo with these files apage-pi-projects unless you ask me for permission.
