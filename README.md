# pi-projects
Raspberry Pi files I created for Python, C#, C, and Scratch
These will only work on Raspberry Pi OS (Raspian) or RPiOS-Based OSes
you will need also guizero python library for GUI Projects. 
NOTE: Some Projects will not work
You can edit and use the code in any way but dont name the a repo with these files apage-pi-projects unless you ask me for permission.
